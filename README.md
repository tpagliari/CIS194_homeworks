# CIS194 Homework Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the CIS194 class at the University of Pennsylvania, spring of 2013. The exercise sheets can be found on the [course website](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html).

In addition to the exercise solutions, you may also find the following:

- **theory** folder: Contains notes on relevant Haskell theoretical concepts.
- **theory/article** folder: Contains notes related to research papers or articles I have found relevant, along with links to the original sources.

Please note that:

1. The quality of the solutions may improve over time as I continue to learn Haskell through these exercises.
2. New exercise sheet solutions will be added in the coming days, weeks, or months as I complete them.
3. I had to make some changes in a lot of modules given in the classes, since I needed to make them compatible with modern Haskell.

This is a **work in progress**. I am working on these exercises in my free time, so the pace of updates may vary. Feel free to use this repository as a reference.
